# OOP Concepts in C++

This repository contains examples and implementations of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C++. The repository is organized into different directories, each focusing on a specific OOP concept.

## Table of Contents
- [Encapsulation](#encapsulation)
- [Inheritance](#inheritance)
- [Polymorphism](#polymorphism)
- [Abstraction](#abstraction)

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class). It helps in data hiding and protecting the internal state of an object.

Key features:
- Private data members
- Public methods to access and modify data
- Information hiding

Example files:
- `encapulation/` directory contains examples of encapsulation implementation

## Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.

Types of inheritance:
- Single inheritance
- Multiple inheritance
- Multilevel inheritance
- Hierarchical inheritance

Example files:
- `inheretence/` directory contains examples of different types of inheritance

## Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. It enables one interface to be used for a general class of actions.

Types of polymorphism:
- Compile-time polymorphism (Function overloading, Operator overloading)
- Runtime polymorphism (Virtual functions, Function overriding)

Example files:
- `polymorpism/` directory contains examples of different types of polymorphism

## Abstraction
Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the user.

Key features:
- Abstract classes
- Pure virtual functions
- Interface implementation

Example files:
- `Abstraction/` directory contains examples of abstraction implementation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (g++, clang++, or MSVC)
- Basic understanding of C++ programming

### Compilation
To compile the examples, use:
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o output
```
